# Hotelier-Rapid API Project

Welcome to the **Hotelier-Rapid API Project**! This project was developed under the mentorship of **Murat Yücedağ** and serves as a hotel reservation system with various functionalities such as catalog management, contact information, reservations, and an "About Us" section. At the heart of the project lies an **Admin Panel**, which is the central control unit of the application.

The project leverages an API-based backend architecture with MSSQL as the database and uses an MVC controller on the frontend to consume the API, providing a smooth and structured user experience.
